This is where I'm going to store all my code for my neuromorphic computing work.
gnfs_lava contains all of my Jupyter notebooks that require Lava, with notebooks for simulating BSS networks and running QS/GNFS.
gnfs_py contains standard python files for running the GNFS sieving step using the neuromorphic approach.
